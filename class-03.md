#### welcome again to my reading notes 
# HTML side.
we will talk about lists , and what type of the lists we have .

There are lots of occasions when we
need to use lists. HTML provides us with
three different types:
1.Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
where each point needs to be identified by a section
number.

The ordered list is created wiyh the (ol) element .
Ordered lists use numbers.

2.Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order).

The unordered list is created with the (ul) element.
Unordered lists use bullets.

3.Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms.

The definition list is created with
the (dl) element and usually
consists of a series of terms and
their definitions.
Inside the (dl) element you will
usually see pairs of <dt> and
(dd) elements.
You can put a second list inside
an (li) element to create a sublist
or nested list.



# css side
At the beginning of this section on CSS, you saw how CSS treats each HTMLelement as if it lives in its own box.
You can set several properties that affect the appearance of
these boxes.
* Control the dimensions of your boxes
* Create borders around boxes
* Set margins and padding for boxes
* Show and hide boxes

# Box Dimentios is :
width  : min-width, max-width to limiying width .
hight : min-height, max-height .

# Border, Margin & Padding
1. Border : Every box has a border (even if
it is not visible or is specified to
be 0 pixels wide). The border
separates the edge of one box
from another.

2. Margin : Margins sit outside the edge
of the border. You can set the
width of a margin to create a
gap between the borders of two
adjacent boxes.

3. Padding : Padding is the space between
the border of a box and any
content contained within it.
Adding padding can increase the
readability of its contents.

# Borders 
* border-width
* border-style
* border-color
* border-radius


# It is possible to hide elements using the display and
visibility properties.

CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image
borders and rounded borders.


# javascript side 

# ARRAYS
An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't
just store one value; it stores a list of values.
Values in an array are accessed as if they are in
a numbered list. It is important to know that the
numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).


Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>)
are used to compare two operands.


# IF ...ELSE STATEMENTS
if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code
if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
