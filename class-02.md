# *Basics of HTML, CSS & JS*

When creating a web page, you add tags
(known as markup) to the contents of the
page. These tags provide extra meaning
and allow browsers to show users the
appropriate structure for the page.

1. Headings
(h1) : useed for main headings
(h2) : used for subheadings
(h3) : used for subheadings
(h4) : used for subheadings
(h5) : used for subheadings
(h6) : used for subheadings

2. Paragraphs
 To create a paragraph, surround
the words that make up the
paragraph with an opening (p)
tag and closing (/p) tag.

3. Bold & Italic
(b)
By enclosing words in the tags
(b) and (/b) we can make
characters appear bold.
The <b> element also represents
a section of text that would be
presented in a visually different
way (for example key words in a
paragraph) although the use of
the (b) element does not imply
any additional meaning.

(i)
By enclosing words in the tags
(i) and (/i) we can make
characters appear italic.
The (i)element also represents
a section of text that would be
said in a different way from
surrounding content — such as
technical terms, names of ships,
foreign words, thoughts, or other
terms that would usually be
italicized.

4. Superscript & Subscript
 (sup)
The (sup) element is used
to contain characters that
should be superscript such
as the suffixes of dates or
mathematical concepts like
raising a number to a power such
as 22.

(sub)
The (sub) element is used to
contain characters that should
be subscript. It is commonly
used with foot notes or chemical
formulas such as H20.



5.Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules
 (br /)
As you have already seen, the
browser will automatically show
each new paragraph or heading
on a new line. But if you wanted
to add a line break inside the
middle of a paragraph you can
use the line break tag (br /).


(hr /)
To create a break between
themes — such as a change of
topic in a book or a new scene
in a play — you can add a
horizontal rule between sections
using the (hr /) tag.


6. Abb reviations
(abbr)
If you use an abbreviation or
an acronym, then the (abbr)
element can be used. A title
attribute on the opening tag is
used to specify the full term.

In this section, we will look at how to
make your web pages more attractive,
controlling the design of them using CSS.


CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of
an element should appear. For example, you can specify that
the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should
appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one
headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.

Using External CSS
1. link

Using Internal CSS
1. style
2. CSS Selectors

Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.

#*CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.*



#### Basic JavaScript Instructions
1. STATEMENTS
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step is known as *a statement*.
Statements should end with a semicolon.

2. COMMENTS
You should write comments to explain what your code does.
They help make your code easier to read and understand.
This can help you and others who read your code.

##WHAT IS A VARIABLE?
A script will have to temporarily
store the bits of information it
needs to do its job. It can store this
data in variables.

4. DATA TYPES
JavaScript distinguishes between numbers,
strings, and true or false values known as
Booleans.

VALUES IN ARRAYS
Values in an array are accessed as if they are in
a numbered list. It is important to know that the
numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).

5. EXPRESSIONS
An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
there are two types of expressions.
1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A
VALUE TO A VARIABLE.
2.EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR
MORE VALUES TO RETURN A
SINGLE VALUE.

Looking at a flowchart (for all but the most basic scripts),
the code can take more than one path, which means the
browser runs different code in different situations. In this
chapter, you will learn how to create and control the flow of
data in your scripts to handle different situations.


To determine which path to take, programmers often
rely upon the following three concepts:
1. EVALUATIONS
You can analyze values in
your scripts to determine
whether or note they
match expected results.
9 DECISIONS & LOOPS
2. DECISIONS
Using the results of
evaluations, you can
decide which path your
script should go down.
3. LOOPS
There are also many
occasions where you will
want to perform the same
set of steps repeatedly.
