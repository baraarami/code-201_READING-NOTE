# *Basics of HTML, CSS & JS*

When creating a web page, you add tags
(known as markup) to the contents of the
page. These tags provide extra meaning
and allow browsers to show users the
appropriate structure for the page.

1. Headings
(h1) : useed for main headings
(h2) : used for subheadings
(h3) : used for subheadings
(h4) : used for subheadings
(h5) : used for subheadings
(h6) : used for subheadings

2. Paragraphs
 To create a paragraph, surround
the words that make up the
paragraph with an opening (p)
tag and closing (/p) tag.

3. Bold & Italic
(b)
By enclosing words in the tags
(b) and (/b) we can make
characters appear bold.
The <b> element also represents
a section of text that would be
presented in a visually different
way (for example key words in a
paragraph) although the use of
the (b) element does not imply
any additional meaning.

(i)
By enclosing words in the tags
(i) and (/i) we can make
characters appear italic.
The (i)element also represents
a section of text that would be
said in a different way from
surrounding content — such as
technical terms, names of ships,
foreign words, thoughts, or other
terms that would usually be
italicized.

4. Superscript & Subscript
 (sup)
The (sup) element is used
to contain characters that
should be superscript such
as the suffixes of dates or
mathematical concepts like
raising a number to a power such
as 22.

(sub)
The (sub) element is used to
contain characters that should
be subscript. It is commonly
used with foot notes or chemical
formulas such as H20.



5.Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules
 (br /)
As you have already seen, the
browser will automatically show
each new paragraph or heading
on a new line. But if you wanted
to add a line break inside the
middle of a paragraph you can
use the line break tag (br /).


(hr /)
To create a break between
themes — such as a change of
topic in a book or a new scene
in a play — you can add a
horizontal rule between sections
using the (hr /) tag.
